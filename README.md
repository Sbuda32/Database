MySQL

Using MySQL to query Umuzi database that i have created on MySQL monitor. The data i used to create tables in the Umuzi database, i got from this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7WvgZL_45jEN1ejxIKMf0b-P0xlIOJj-XFOVoHC00Q/edit.
All the changes that have been made to the data are saved in my local machine.
The file sql_queries.sql in my repository contains all the queries i've made to the data in my local machine.
